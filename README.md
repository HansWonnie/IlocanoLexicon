## Project Description
This project aims to build digital resources for natural languages spoken in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) and neighboring regions of the Philippines. It contributes to language preservation, documentation, and the development of tools for natural language processing (NLP), particularly in support of governance and social institutions.

### Objectives
- Construct **electronic lexicons** for selected local languages.
- Collect and digitize **raw linguistic resources** (e.g., documents, song lyrics, articles, social media data).
- Develop or prototype **NLP-based tools** or submit a **journal-style report** discussing tool design.
- Support **eGovernance** through accessible, localized language technology.
