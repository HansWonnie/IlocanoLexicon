## Naming Convention

This document outlines the naming conventions to be adopted across all components of the RECALL project. Consistent naming improves organization, traceability, and collaboration, especially in managing multiple language resources and digital assets.


1. General Guidelines
    - Use lowercase letters only. Avoid uppercase.
    - Use hyphens (-) to separate words. Avoid spaces or underscores unless otherwise noted.
    - Be descriptive but concise. Include enough information to identify the content without being verbose.
    - Avoid special characters. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), or underscores (_) where allowed.

2. File Naming Conventions
    - CSV File:
        - csv-[type]-[document-name].csv
        - e.g., csv-social-facebook-scraped.csv
    - JSON File:
        - json-[type]-[document-name]-.json
        - e.g., json-published-articles-zhang.json
    - Other File:
        - [file-type]-[type]-[document-name].[file-extention]
        - e.g., xml-published-articles-zhang.xml
    Note: If a document is referenced only add the last name of the FIRST author.

3. Variables
    - If variables will be defined have them follow the snake_case convention
